In this [HPCwire article](https://www.hpcwire.com/2020/03/04/exascale-watch-el-capitan-will-use-amd-cpus-gpus-to-reach-2-exaflops/), LLNL's CTO Bronis de Supinski describes the collaborative process involved in preparing software deployment on the forthcoming exascale-capable supercomputer, El Capitan. Spack is expected to be the chosen deployment tool for the new machine. The article announces the Department of Energy's choice of AMD as El Capitan's processor technology (CPUs and GPUs) vendor. El Capitan is anticipated to deliver 2 exaflops (peak double-precision) performance when it becomes operational in 2023.
