The [Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org/), a joint effort between the DOE Office of Science and NNSA, brings several national laboratories together to address the hardware, software, and application challenges inherent in the organizationsâ€™ scientific and national security missions. Spack has been adopted as the ECP's standard [software deployment](https://www.exascaleproject.org/research-group/software-ecosystem/) tool.

The ECP's [annual meeting](https://whova.com/embedded/event/aecm_202001/) on February 3-7 included two Spack sessions led by LLNL's Todd Gamblin and Greg Becker:

- **Spack roundtable** where participants learned about recent and upcoming developments, networked with other HPC sites and developers using Spack, discussed feedback to guide future directions, and generally bolstered the Spack community within the ECP.
- **Spack tutorial** that introduced attendees to Spack, teaching them how to automatically build and install over 3,300 packages; develop their own packages; and contribute packages to Spack for others to use.
